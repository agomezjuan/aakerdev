# AakerDev Portfolio

Professional portfolio website built with Astro to showcase technical skills and experience to talent recruiters.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates:

- Full-stack development capabilities
- Modern web technologies expertise
- Project management and documentation skills
- Professional presentation of technical work

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Astro, TypeScript, responsive design
- **Project Showcase**: Detailed case studies with live demos
- **Technical Blog**: Insights and learning experiences
- **Professional Presentation**: Optimized for recruiters and employers

## ðŸ”€ Branch Naming Convention

We follow a structured naming pattern for feature branches:

```
feature/{issue-number}-{short-description}
```

**Rules:**

- Maximum 50 characters total
- Use kebab-case for descriptions
- Always include issue number
- Examples:
  - `feature/2-design-portfolio-arch`
  - `feature/3-implement-home-page`
  - `feature/5-projects-showcase`

**Creating branches:**

1. **Automated script** (recommended): `./scripts/branch 2`
2. Use GitHub's "Create a branch" button on issues
3. Or manually: `git checkout -b feature/2-design-portfolio-arch`

**Branch Script Features:**

- âœ… Fetches issue title automatically
- âœ… Sanitizes and truncates to 50 chars
- âœ… Creates from latest main branch
- âœ… Optional remote push with upstream
- âœ… Links to issue for reference

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command            | Action                                                  |
